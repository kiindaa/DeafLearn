📋 Project Overview
This project is designed to [describe the project objective here]. The goal is to create a software solution that addresses [specific problem or need]. This project will utilize Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean design.

🛠️ Project Setup Steps
1. GitHub Repository Setup 🗂️
Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one) at https://github.com.
One team member should create a new repository:
Go to GitHub → Repositories → New.
Name the repository (e.g., java-project-teamX).
Add a description (e.g., "A Java-based software engineering project").
Select Public or Private.
Add a README.md (this file).
Invite team members as collaborators:
Go to Settings → Collaborators.
Add team members by GitHub usernames.
2. Clone the Repository ⬇️
Each team member should:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
Navigate into the project folder:
cd [repository-name]
⚙️ Project Development Steps
1. Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 📝
Functional Requirements (FR): List the core features the software must perform (e.g., user registration, data validation).
Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): Define the system's quality attributes, like performance, security, scalability.
2. Select a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 🔄
Your team should select an appropriate SDLC for managing the project's development. Here are some examples:

Waterfall: A linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Agile (Scrum, Kanban): An iterative approach where the project is developed incrementally.
Spiral: Focuses on risk management and is ideal for large, complex projects.
V-Model: An extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes testing at each phase.
After reviewing, choose the best model for your project and document your choice in this README.md.

3. Define Your Process (If Agile) ⚡
If you choose Agile, such as Scrum or Kanban, follow these steps:

Scrum Example
Roles:
Product Owner: Defines the vision and backlog.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the process.
Team Members: Develop the product.
Sprint Planning: Break the project into Sprints (1-2 week cycles) with goals.
Daily Standups: Short meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
Sprint Review & Retrospective: After each Sprint, review the work and reflect on how to improve.
