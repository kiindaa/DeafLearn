📋 Project Overview
This project is designed to enhance the educational experience for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. By integrating innovative features tailored to their unique needs, DeafLearn aims to create an inclusive learning environment that supports academic success. The goal is to create a software solution that addresses the daily challenges faced by deaf students in traditional educational settings. This project will utilize Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean design.


⚙️ Project Development Steps
1. Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 📝
Functional Requirements (FR):
1. User Authentication:
 . Users (students, teachers, and administrators) must be able to create accounts and log in securely.
 . Password recovery options should be available.
2. Course Management:
 . Teachers can create, edit, and delete courses.
 . Students can enroll in available courses and view course materials.
3. Interactive Learning Tools:
 . Integration of sign language videos to explain concepts.
 . Text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities for communication.
4. Assessment and Feedback:
 . Ability for teachers to create quizzes and assignments.
 . Students can submit assignments and receive feedback.
5. Communication Features:
 . Real-time chat functionality with text and video options.
 . Discussion forums for students to interact with peers and instructors.
6. Accessibility Features:
 . Customizable interface options (e.g., font size, color contrast).
 . Support for multiple languages, most importantly sign language.
7. Progress Tracking:
 . Students can view their academic progress and grades.
 . Teachers can monitor student performance and engagement levels.
8. Resource Library:
 . A repository of educational materials (videos, articles, etc.) specifically designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing students with animated sign language avatars.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): 
1. Usability:
 . The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all users.
2. Performance: 
 . The platform should provide a quick and seamless experience for users, handling a large number of users at the same time without slowing down.
3. Reliability:
 . The system should ensure that every user can access the platform consistently.
 . Data backup should occur daily to prevent data loss and ensure data integrity.
 4. Scalability:
 . The architecture should support the addition of new features and an increasing number of users without requiring a complete redesign.
5. Security: 
 . User data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
 . To safeguard sensitive information, the system must utilize role-based access control.
6. Maintenance:
 . The codebase should follow OOP principles for modularity and ease of updates.
 . Documentation should be comprehensive to assist future developers in understanding the system.


3. Define Your Process (If Agile) ⚡
If you choose Agile, such as Scrum or Kanban, follow these steps:
Scrum Example
Roles:
Product Owner: Defines the vision and backlog.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the process.
Team Members: Develop the product.
Sprint Planning: Break the project into Sprints (1-2 week cycles) with goals.
Daily Standups: Short meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
Sprint Review & Retrospective: After each Sprint, review the work and reflect on how to improve.
